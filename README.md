# Explosivo!!
A modo kit by @csprance to toggle morphs on and off for baking things wth Explode morph maps.

## Installation
This is a modo kit so install it like normal. I've only tested this on Modo 10, but I don't think it's doing anything
fancy. Let me know if you run into any issues and if it works on other versions of modo!

* Extract into
`%appdata%/Luxology/Kits`
* Click the little Explodey icon on and off to toggle the morph
* Alt Click the Explodey icon to set the explode map name (Defaults to Explode)
